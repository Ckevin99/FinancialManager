# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name:

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 

    __Sprint 1__

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |     __X__     |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |

|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

__You must create a database using a cloud service for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.__

__Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.__

__Implement user authentication.__

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    __Youtube__
    __Geeksforgeeks__

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    __Learn how to use the basic of firebase__
    __Learn how to insert and remove data using a language__
    __Learn how to make my API key safe.__


3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    __Personal Finance Manager__
    __The program will be able to take track of the income and expenses and other features.__

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    __I will work in the module every day at home for one hour at 6 p.m. or in college during the gap between classes.__

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    __Very often, I don't start working on my assignments early, so I will try to create mini checkpoints for my program.__

   __I know Python well, but I would like to use JavaScript instead. It would be an opportunity to learn and develop skills in it, but if in the first 2 hours I donÂ´t get much progress, I will try to revise my logic and adjust my plan in the module.__


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

No

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|

|Individual Module|        12:13      |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
I made a plan to work every day on this, but I just started to work more consistently on it at the end of this week.
A thing that helped me this week was the copilot. I used it as a teacher to help me with javascript.
Using a cronometer to have breaks to rest and to do other important things helped me today.
